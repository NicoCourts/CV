\section{RESEARCH INTERESTS}  

%I am a student of Prof. Julia Pevtsova studying the representation theory of algebraic groups and 
%other objects using tools from geometry and cohomology theory. Looking forward, I am particularly
%interested in the study of quantum groups and (non-commutative) $q$-deformations of objects in algebraic 
%geometry as well as considering problems related to the geometric Langland's program.

% More applied interests
I am a student of Prof. Julia Pevtsova studying the representation theory of group schemes and other 
algebraic structures using tools from geometry, category theory, and homological algebra. While my thesis 
is likely to be of a highly theoretical character, it requires that I be skilled in many different areas of math and 
I am conversant in the languages of combinatorics, topology, analysis, and optimization.

What's more, I am always looking for ways to ground what I am learning in the 
real world. Applications that make me particularly excited are that of artificial general intelligence and 
interpretability of mathematical models which, I believe, can serve a vital role in the realization of AGI.

\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}

{\bf Current Focus}\\
In the recent past, my studies have been focusing on understanding the rational representations of $\operatorname{GL}_n$ as established by Schur in his thesis 
and later work (and later translated and elucidated by Green). More recently, Friedlander, Suslin, Krause,
and others have found equivalent categories that more readily afford monoidal structure in the interest of establishing the monoidicity 
of the Schur-Weyl functor and examining the interactions between different forms of duality. My current goal is to understand this functor better and to 
explore how it relates the structures of two different categories while keeping an eye towards how this fits into a broader context.

\section{TEACHING EXPERIENCE}

{\bf Graduate Teaching Assistant} \hfill Autumn 2016 -- Present \\
University of Washington, Seattle, WA

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt % Reduce space between items
\item\textbf{As an instructor:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Math 124 -- Calculus I (Summer 2018)\vspace{5pt}

	I put my own twist on the standard Calc I curriculum by deciding to focus on high-level understanding along with cultivating problem-solving techniques and a mathematical mindset.
	This idea was loosely based on that of the flipped classroom; students were encouraged using quizzes to read the textbook before any material was discussed in class and large portions of contact time with instructors were dedicated to working on challenging problem sets and presenting solutions to the class.
	Technology was used frequently and liberally as a way to both bolster understanding through visual aids and as a means to solicit frequent feedback from students to monitor their understanding and progress.\vspace{5pt}
	\item Math 308 -- Matrix Algebra (Spring 2019)\vspace{5pt}
	
	My focus during this quarter was on developing the students' ability to solve problems they hadn't seen before. In service of this, we dedicated a third of our contact time to solving problems in small groups with my oversight.
	My initial course structure wasn't adequately meeting the needs of the class (which I determined from soliciting feedback), so after the first midterm we pivoted to having more worked-out examples in class, for which the students were thankful.
	In order to encourage students to investigate how linear algebra was used in the real world, the students were assigned a poster project. Topics included applications of linear algebra in medical imaging, computer graphics, and in the social sciences. 
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{As a teaching assistant:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Math 120 -- Precalculus (Autumn 2017)
	\item Math 124 -- Calculus I (Winter 2017, Winter 2019)
	\item Math 125 -- Calculus II (Autumn 2016, Spring 2017)
	\item Math 126 -- Calculus III (Summer 2017, Winter 2018, Spring 2018)
	\item Math 327 -- Introductory Real Analysis (Summer 2019)
	\item Math 381 -- Discrete Mathematical Modeling (Autumn 2018)
	\item Math 403 -- Group Theory (Winter 2020)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
 
{\bf Lead Teaching Assistant and Instructor} \hfill Summer 2016 \\
SCS Noonan Scholars (previously South Central Scholars), Los Angeles, CA
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
\item Independently developed and delivered  approximately 50 hours of instruction and five exams to gifted university-bound students in calculus 2 and 3.
\item Total of 100 contact hours, including daily supevised worksheet sessions.
\item Took the initiative to deliver weekly lectures in higher mathematics (number theory, knot theory, differential equations, etc.) along with entry-level problems that allowed students to get a sense of the “flavor” of these fields.
\end{itemize} 

{\bf Various Teaching and Mentorship Positions} \hfill Spring 2012 -- Summer 2013 \\
Citrus College, Glendora, CA
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
\item {\bf PAGE Program Tutor} Assisted a licensed teacher in the education of a class of middle school children intended to reinforce the previous year’s learning and to prevent “backsliding”. Personally instructed a small group of students who were prepared to learn more advanced topics in intermediate algebra.
\item {\bf SIGMA Mentor} Took on a small group of students each semester utilizing a holistic approach to education – supplementing standard tutoring with more in-depth educational guidance and planning.
\item {\bf Math Tutor} Instructed students in the fast-paced Math Success Center where I provided homework help in all math classes through linear algebra and differential equations.
\end{itemize}
